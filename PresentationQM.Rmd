# 1. Objective 

<h>To determine the impact of weather on consumer behavior and retail sales</h>

# 2. Why? 

- Physiological
- Psychological

# 3. Business Implication

- Potential to improve demand forecasting at Retailer level that can improve major supply chain functions such as
  - Inventory management
  - Material Planning
  - Price Optimization

# 4. Methodology

- **Dependent Variable:**
  - Monthly Retail Sales for the Clothing and Footwear Industry by QC, ON, and BC
- **Independent Variables:**
  - Total Snow
  - Mean Temperature
  - Total Rain
  - Wind Speed
- **Control Variables:**
  - CPI
  - Unemployment Rate
  - Disposable Income
  - Consumer Confidence
  

# a) Distribution Analysis
```{r 2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Figure1.png")
```

# b) Multivariate Analysis
```{r 3, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Figure4.png")
```
# c) Correlation Matrix
```{r 1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Figure2.png")
```

# a) Result
```{r 4, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Table3.png")
```

# b) Validation
```{r 5, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Figure5.png")
```

# 7. Conclusion
- H1: Retail Sales decreases with rainfall \checkmark
- H2: Retail Sales decreases with snowfall \checkmark
- H3: Retail Sales decreases with wind speed \checkmark
- H4: Retail Sales is negatively related to mean temperature X

# 8. Limitations
